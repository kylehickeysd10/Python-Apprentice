Turtles with a loop. 

Study the previous program, 05a_Loop_with_Turtle.py, and then
write a new program that uses a loop to draw a pentagon.
( You can cut and past most of it! )





import turtle as turtle

screen = turtle.Screen()
screen.setup(width=600, height=600)
screen.bgcolor('white')

t = turtle.Turtle()
t.penup()
t.shape("turtle")
